# 🚀 WebSocket Implementation Guide

## Overview

We've successfully implemented real-time messaging using Socket.io, replacing the polling mechanism with WebSocket connections. This provides instant message delivery, typing indicators, and a more professional chat experience.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **Socket.io Server Infrastructure**

**Files Created:**
- `back-end/src/socket/socketServer.ts` - Main Socket.io server initialization
- `back-end/src/socket/socketMiddleware.ts` - JWT authentication for WebSocket connections
- `back-end/src/socket/socketHandlers.ts` - Event handlers for chat operations

**Files Modified:**
- `back-end/src/app.ts` - Integrated Socket.io with Express HTTP server

#### 2. **Key Features Implemented**

✅ **Real-time Message Delivery** - Messages appear instantly without polling  
✅ **JWT Authentication** - Secure WebSocket connections using existing auth tokens  
✅ **Typing Indicators** - See when the other person is typing  
✅ **Read Receipts** - Messages marked as read in real-time  
✅ **Room-based Messaging** - Each user has their own room for targeted message delivery  
✅ **Optimistic Updates** - Instant UI feedback while messages are being sent  
✅ **Connection Status** - Visual indicator showing connection state  

---

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **Socket.io Client Infrastructure**

**Files Created:**
- `front-end/src/services/socketService.ts` - Socket.io client service
- `front-end/src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx` - React context for socket management

**Files Modified:**
- `front-end/src/App.tsx` - Added SocketProvider wrapper
- `front-end/src/components/chat/Chat.tsx` - Complete rewrite to use WebSocket

#### 2. **UI Enhancements**

✅ **Typing Indicator** - Animated dots when user is typing  
✅ **Connection Status Badge** - Green "Connected" / Red "Reconnecting..." indicator  
✅ **Optimistic UI Updates** - Messages appear instantly before server confirmation  
✅ **Smooth Animations** - No flickering or visual glitches  
✅ **Error Handling** - Failed messages are removed with error notification

## 🔧 How It Works

### Message Flow

```
User Types Message
    ↓
Optimistic UI Update (instant)
    ↓
Socket.emit('chat:send_message')
    ↓
Backend Authentication & Validation
    ↓
Save to MongoDB
    ↓
Acknowledgment to Sender
    ↓
Real-time Broadcast to Receiver
    ↓
Replace Optimistic Message with Real Data
```

### Typing Indicator Flow

```
User Types in Input
    ↓
Socket.emit('chat:typing_start')
    ↓
Backend broadcasts to receiver
    ↓
Receiver sees typing dots
    ↓
After 2 seconds of inactivity
    ↓
Socket.emit('chat:typing_stop')
    ↓
Typing dots disappear
```

## 📡 Socket Events

### Client → Server

| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `chat:send_message` | `{ receiverId, content }` | Send a new message |
| `chat:typing_start` | `{ receiverId }` | User started typing |
| `chat:typing_stop` | `{ receiverId }` | User stopped typing |
| `chat:mark_read` | `{ senderId }` | Mark messages as read |

### Server → Client

| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `chat:new_message` | `Message` | New message received |
| `chat:user_typing` | `{ userId, isTyping }` | Typing status update |
| `chat:messages_read` | `{ readBy }` | Messages marked as read |

---

## 🔐 Security

- **JWT Authentication**: All WebSocket connections require a valid JWT, checked once at connect by `socketMiddleware.ts` with the same `verifyAuthToken` as the REST API: the signature, the token's `tv` against the user's current `tokenVersion`, and that the account isn't deactivated
- **Session Revocation**: Deactivating an account increments its `tokenVersion` and calls `disconnectUserSockets(userId)` (`socketServer.ts`), closing that user's open sockets. Clients disconnected by the server don't reconnect on their own, and a reconnect with the revoked token is rejected
- **Connection Validation**: Messages can only be sent to connected users
- **User Rooms**: Each user joins their own room (`user:{userId}`) for private messaging
- **Authorization**: Backend validates sender/receiver relationship before saving messages

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the Backend

```bash
cd back-end
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
Connected to MongoDB
✅ Socket.io server initialized
🚀 Server started on port 8080
📡 WebSocket server ready
```

### 2. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd front-end
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Real-time Features

1. **Open two browsers** (or incognito + regular window)
2. **Login as different users** in each browser
3. **Navigate to chat** between the two users
4. **Type a message** - see it appear instantly on both sides
5. **Start typing** - see the typing indicator on the other side
6. **Check connection status** - green dot = connected

## 📊 Performance Benefits

### Before (Polling)

- **Latency**: 0-3 seconds delay
- **Network Requests**: Constant HTTP requests every 3 seconds
- **Server Load**: High (unnecessary polling even when idle)
- **Battery Usage**: High on mobile devices
- **Real-time Feel**: ❌ Delayed

### After (WebSocket)

- **Latency**: < 100ms instant delivery
- **Network Requests**: Only when events occur
- **Server Load**: Low (event-driven)
- **Battery Usage**: Minimal
- **Real-time Feel**: ✅ Instant

## 🎨 UI Features

### Connection Status Indicator
- **Green dot + "Connected"**: Socket connected and ready
- **Red pulsing dot + "Reconnecting..."**: Socket attempting to reconnect

### Typing Indicator
- **Three animated dots**: Appears when other user is typing
- **Auto-dismiss**: Disappears after 2 seconds of no typing

### Message Bubbles
- **Sent messages**: Right-aligned with coral background
- **Received messages**: Left-aligned with white background
- **Timestamps**: Formatted as time, "Yesterday", or date

### Optimistic Updates
- **Instant feedback**: Messages appear immediately when sent
- **Seamless replacement**: Optimistic messages replaced with server data
- **Error handling**: Failed messages removed with error notification

---

## 🔄 Auto-Reconnection

Socket.io automatically handles reconnection:
- **Max reconnection attempts**: 5
- **Reconnection delay**: 1 second
- **Visual feedback**: Connection status badge updates automatically
- **Message buffering**: Messages sent during reconnection are queued

---

## 🐛 Debugging

### Backend Logs

Socket connections and disconnections are logged:
```
✅ Socket connected: User 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 (abc123)
❌ Socket disconnected: User 507f1f77bcf86cd799439011 (abc123)
```

### Frontend Console

Check browser console for:
```
✅ Socket connected: abc123
❌ Socket disconnected: transport close
🔄 Socket reconnected after 1 attempts
```

### Common Issues

1. **"Authentication error: No token provided"**
   - Ensure user is logged in
   - Token should be in localStorage

2. **"Authentication error: Invalid token"**
   - The token is expired, or was revoked (the account was deactivated on another device)
   - Sign in again; the app normally redirects to `/login` by itself

3. **"Authentication error: Account deactivated"**
   - Expected while the account is deactivated; reactivate it from the prompt shown after signing in

4. **Messages not appearing**
   - Check connection status badge
   - Verify both users are connected
   - Check browser console for errors

5. **Typing indicator stuck**
   - Refresh the page
   - Check network connectivity
